# TextBasedGame

  The goal of this project is to create a text based game engine that allows for a high level of character customization and uses a method of description that allows for more complex descriptions than typical text based RPGs. My eventual goal is for it to read more like an interactive story, with a narrative featuring the player in the text rather than using the text as just a representation of what is currently in the room with you, or what you are fighting. While I've put a lot of thought into the description system, and drawn up some plans for how to implement it, I do want to focus on getting some key RPG features implemented before I start actually coding and finalizing that system, as the way I code other core features will direct how I ultimately decide to do the description system, and what I decide to include first.
